This repo is intended to contain solutions for <http://sortable.com/blog/coding-challenge/>.

To build solutions, simply run "make".

All solutions assume that the listings.txt and products.txt files are in the current directory.

All solutions write the final JSON to stdout.  Run like this:

./match > output.json

== Status of Solutions ==

A program is never really "complete", and that is especially true of this problem.  I will probably for quite some time wake up with things to try that might improve precision or recall.

Haskell: Working
Scala: Only does initial grouping by manufaturer
