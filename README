This repo is intended to contain solutions for <http://sortable.com/blog/coding-challenge/>.

To build solutions, simply run "make".

All solutions assume that the listings.txt and products.txt files are in the current directory.

All solutions write the final JSON to stdout.  Run like this:

./match > output.json

== Status of Solutions ==

Haskell: Near complete (see TODO)
Scala: Only does initial grouping by manufaturer
