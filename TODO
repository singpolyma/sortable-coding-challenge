== Haskell ==

* Canon-T3 matches "Kit +3" if "Rebel" also appears in the title
* Models formatted like: DSLR-<code> do not match titles "... <code> Digital SLR" and similar.  This may require probabilistic reasoning (Bayes/Decicion network?  Seems likely more prone to false-positive) -- This has been somewhat mitigated by stripping common prefixes from models
